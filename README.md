Hi! This a Store Business analystics. Other repositories are more data science than data analytics.

This will be more SQL+PowerBI kind of project.

- Pre-Processing:
  - Some adjustment in Python on the CSV, as it was giving me ar error on the upload on my postgresql server (some '' were giving problems)
  - SQL cleaning: CAST, INITCAPS, trim spaces, null values, inconsistency with dates, remove duplicates. New column: shipment days.
  - Exported new CSV from postgresql query tool
