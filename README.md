Hi! This repository is focused on Store Business Analytics, with a more Data Analyticsâ€“oriented approach (SQL + Power BI), compared to other projects which are more Data Science heavy.

- Pre-Processing:
  - Some adjustments in Python on the CSV, as it was giving me ar error on the upload on my postgresql server (some '' were giving problems)
  - SQL cleaning:
      - Standardized text fields with TRIM() and INITCAP().
      - Handled NULL values, fixed date inconsistencies (Ship Date < Order Date), and removed duplicates.
      - Casted columns to proper types (INT, NUMERIC, etc.).
      - Added a new calculated column: shipping_days (difference between Ship Date and Order Date).
      - Exported new CSV from postgresql query tool
- Power BI:
